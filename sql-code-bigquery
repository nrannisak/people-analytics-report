---- Hence, the employee retention rate from 2010 to 2011 is 97,79%, which increases by 2% from the year before

--- Question 2
--- Company Growth Rate

---- By the data, we can conclude that the company growth rate is around 2.69% based on the increase number of employees, which increased by 1.14% compared to the last year growth

--- Question 3

--- From the calculation, there are 4.458 employees that are eligible for the program.
--- Hence, the budget that needs to be allocated by the company is estimated to be $198.793.400

--- Question 4
--- Employees Gender Across Age Group

-- Based on the data, the company is succeeded in maintain a roughly equal number of male and female across the age group, with less than 3% deviation with the "above 60 years" as the exception

--- Top 3 departments and city in terms in hiring is won by Bakery department in Vancover with 28 new joiners
